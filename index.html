    <h1 class="intros">The Waiting Place...</h1>
    <p>...for people just waiting.<br>
        Waiting for a train to go<br>
        or a bus to come, or a plane to go<br>
        or the mail to come, or the rain to go<br>
        or the phone to ring, or the snow to snow<br>
        or the waiting around for a Yes or No<br>
        or waiting for their hair to grow.<br>
        Everyone is just waiting.<br></p>

       <p>Waiting for the fish to bite<br>
        or waiting for the wind to fly a kite<br>
        or waiting around for Friday night<br>
        or waiting, perhaps, for their Uncle Jake<br>
        or a pot to boil, or a Better Break<br>
        or a string of pearls, or a pair of pants<br>
        or a wig with curls, or Another Chance.<br>
        Everyone is just waiting.</p>

       <p>NO!<br>
        That's not for you!</p>

        <p>Somehow you'll escape<br>
        all that waiting and staying<br>
        You'll find the bright places<br>
        where Boom Bands are playing.<br></p>

        <p>With banner flip-flapping,<br>
        once more you'll ride high!<br>
        Ready for anything under the sky.<br>
        Ready because you're that kind of a guy!<br></p>

        <p>Oh, the places you'll go! There is fun to be done!</p>
