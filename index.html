    <h1 class="intros">The Waiting Place...</h1> 
    <p>...for people just waiting.
        Waiting for a train to go
        or a bus to come, or a plane to go
        or the mail to come, or the rain to go
        or the phone to ring, or the snow to snow
        or the waiting around for a Yes or No
        or waiting for their hair to grow.
        Everyone is just waiting.
        
        Waiting for the fish to bite
        or waiting for the wind to fly a kite
        or waiting around for Friday night
        or waiting, perhaps, for their Uncle Jake
        or a pot to boil, or a Better Break
        or a string of pearls, or a pair of pants
        or a wig with curls, or Another Chance.
        Everyone is just waiting.
        
        NO!
        That's not for you!
        
        Somehow you'll escape
        all that waiting and staying
        You'll find the bright places
        where Boom Bands are playing.
        
        With banner flip-flapping,
        once more you'll ride high!
        Ready for anything under the sky.
        Ready because you're that kind of a guy!
        
        Oh, the places you'll go! There is fun to be done!</p>
